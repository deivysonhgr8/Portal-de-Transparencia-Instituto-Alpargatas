# Instituto Alpargatas Transparency Portal

This project describes the development of a **Transparency Portal** for the **Alpargatas Institute**, a non-profit organization focused on improving public education in partner municipalities.

The initiative was created to **democratize access to information** about the Institute‚Äôs social impact, following a survey that revealed **75% of a 155-person sample were unaware of the organization and its work**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Educational Quality Index (IQE)

At the core of the project is the creation of a new multidimensional metric, the **IQE**.

* the IQE is calculated using a **weighted average** of five variables:

  * **Student performance (SAEB)**
  * **School flow (IDEB)**
  * **School infrastructure (School Census)**
  * **Socioeconomic level (INSE)**
  * **Teacher training (AFD)**

* The weights for each variable were **objectively defined using Factor Analysis**.

---

### 2. Predictive Investment Model

A **machine learning model**, trained on simulated data, was developed to **estimate the return on investment (ROI)** in terms of IQE improvement.

‚û°Ô∏è This tool enables the Institute to make strategic decisions by identifying municipalities with the **highest potential for educational improvement**.

---

### 3. Interactive Web Portal

The portal consolidates all this information into an **interactive web platform**, which includes:

* **Interactive map** displaying IQE scores
* **Detailed municipal analyses**
* **Chat interface** allowing natural language queries about the data

---

### 4. Innovative Communication Strategy

The project proposes a communication strategy using **QR Codes on Alpargatas products**, such as Havaianas sandals.

‚û°Ô∏è By scanning the code, consumers are directed to the portal, directly linking their purchase to the educational transformation it supports.
